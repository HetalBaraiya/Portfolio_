# 🌟 Hetal Baraiya – Web Dev with a Creative Spark!

Hey there! I’m **Hetal Baraiya**, a front-end sorcerer 🧙‍♀️ who crafts sleek, responsive websites using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — with a pinch of magic ✨ (and sometimes `particles.js` 🎇).

This is my **personal portfolio** – where code meets creativity, and every pixel has a purpose.

- 📥 **Downloadable CV**
- 🙅‍♀️ Image protection (no right-click snooping!)
